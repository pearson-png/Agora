# Agora
Agora is a course review website that emphasizes community discussion. Agoras were the open discussion places for Ancient Greek citizens, and we want to create a similar online discussion space for academic experiences. It can be described as RateMyProfessors.com meets traditional forums. We aim to provide a community specific experience to Wellesley students where they can review the courses they are taking in real time. 

The user logs in and sees a feed of the most recent reviews written at Wellesley College. They can use the search in the navigation bar or filtering on the left hand side of the screen to narrow down the feed to a specific department, course, or professor. If the search is narrowed down to a single course or professor, an average rating will be displayed. Each user posts anonymously with a randomly generated username. The user can change their username anytime. These posts are reviews for professors and/or courses with a star ranking system and text. The posts have downvotes, upvotes and comments. 

This is a full-stack project connected to a MySQL database on the back-end via Flask and on the front-end via Ajax, with HTML templates arranged using Jinja2.
